            <ul>
            <h3>What did you manage to create during this period?</h3>
            <li><p>I focused on creating or improving the main sections (About, Projects, Skills, Contact) and setting up the foundation for my CS Maths & Tools page. I created a clean HTML structure for my portfolio homepage and began styling with CSS to ensure a professional appearance. </p>
            </li>
                
            <h3>What did you find most challenging?</h3>
            <li><p> I think I found it difficult to understand the GitHub Pages workflow at first, learning how to push my files to the repository, set up the correct branch, and make my site live took several attempts. Additionally, writing about my projects and skills in clear, professional English whilst being concise proved challenging, as I wanted to showcase my work without writing excessively long descriptions.</p>
            </li>
                
            <h3>What did you learn about web development or computer science maths from this work?</h3>
            <li><p>In terms of computer science maths, I improved my understanding of the binary number system and how decimal numbers are converted into binary. I learned how binary represents data using only 0s and 1s, which are the fundamental building blocks of computing.</p>
            </li>
                
            <h3>What did you learn about web development or computer science?</h3>
            <li><p> I learned about HTML semantic elements and how they improve both accessibility and code readability.</p>
            </li>
                
            <h3>What is one improvement you can guarantee for the upcoming weeks?</h3>
            <li><p> I want to be able to recall various commands and be able t implement them in many wesite codes. I also want to be able to master CSS and its elements</p>
